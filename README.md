## ‚ú® Features

* **Authentication Flow:** Complete signup and login functionality using `AsyncStorage` as a mock database.
* **State Management:** Global auth state is managed cleanly with React's Context API.
* **Form Handling:** Robust, type-safe forms built with `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation.

    * `ControlledInput` with icon and password-toggle support.
    * `Button` with variants for intent, size, and style, built with `tailwind-variants`.
* **Navigation:** A smooth, auth-aware navigation system built with `react-navigation` that automatically directs users to the correct screen.
* **Iconography:** Beautiful and lightweight icons from `lucide-react-native`.
* **TypeScript:** End-to-end type safety.
